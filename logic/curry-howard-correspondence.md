# Curry–Howard correspondence

## Simply-typed λ-calculus ~ intuitionistic natural deduction ~ cartesian closed category 

## second-order lambda calculus ~ second-order logic 
Quantification over propositional variables in second-order logic corresponds to type abstraction in second-order lambda calculus.

Existential quantification in second-order logic corresponds precisely to data abstraction.

## Session Types ~ Intuitionistic linear logic
