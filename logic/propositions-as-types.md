# Propositions as Types

> It describes a correspondence between a given logic and a given programming language. At the surface, it says that for each proposition in the logic there is a corresponding type in the programming language —
and vice versa. Thus we have \
**propositions as types**. \
It goes deeper, in that for each proof of a given proposition, there is a program of the corresponding type—and vice versa. Thus we also have \
**proofs as programs**.

Many variant names appear in the literature, including Formulae as Types.
