# Computational calculus
from: Meredith, Stay, "Logic as a distributive law"
 > In his seminal paper, "Functions as Processes", Milner developed what is now **the standard presentation of a computational calculus**. The presentation consists of 
> - *a grammar* describing the primary data type over which computations are carried out, 
> - *a structural equivalence*, used to erase syntactic differences that are irrelevant to computation, and 
> - *a set of rewrite rules* describing how to realize computation through operations on the data structures. 

> On one hand, this generalizes universal algebraâ€™s generators and relations presentation, with the grammar replacing the generators as the free construction, the structural equiv alence replacing the relations, and the rewrites providing the computational semantics.
