# Context Free Grammar (CFG)

A context-free grammar is a certain type of [formal grammar](/formal-grammar.md): a set of production 
rules that describe all possible strings in a given [formal language](/formal-language.md).
Languages generated by context-free grammars are known as [context-free languages (CFL)](/context-free-language.md).
Different context-free grammars can generate the same context-free language (??? Example).
The language equality question (do two given context-free grammars generate the same language?) 
is [undecidable](./logic/decidability.md) (??? What it means).

A context-free grammar is a quadruple: G = (V, T, P, S)

where
+ V is a finite set of variables.
+ T is a finite set of terminals.
+ P is a finite set of productions of the form A → α, where A is a variable and α ∈ (V ∪ T)*
+ S is a designated variable called the start symbol.
