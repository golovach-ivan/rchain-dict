# Confused deputy problem
A confused deputy is a computer program that is innocently fooled by some other party into misusing its [authority](authority.md). 
It is a specific type of [privilege escalation](privilege-escalation.md). In information security, 
the confused deputy problem is often cited as an example of why [capability-based security](capability-based-security.md) is important, 
as [capability systems]((capability-based-security.md)) protect against this, whereas [access control list-based systems](access-control-list.md) do not.[1]
